## What The Hell Is Water? (Is This a Blog?)


#### Who Am I?
My name is Adam. I'm originally from Utah and I migrated to Montana for Grad School where I earned a Ph.D. in Mathematics. I enjoy skiing, skateboarding, running (when my body allows it), walking, and karaoke. I like coffee, cats, dogs, and growing vegetables. I like working on puzzles, tinkering around on a mandolin, fixing my old Subaru, and talking with strangers. I like to understand how things work and I like to build and create.  

#### What Am I Doing Here?
I'm going to write about things that interest me and things which I am currently learning about. In an effort to be consistent I will try to write an article every Wednesday. The topics I will write on will include mathematics, statistics, programming, or anything else I want to record. I hope to write in a way that a non-expert can easily digest (which might annoy an expert) and might incite someone to seek out further discussion or resources. 

#### Why Am I Doing It?
Well I've found it to be important for me to do something, anything at all! Here are some of my reasons:
* It will give me an opportunity to engage with mathematics despite leaving the _'Ivory Tower'_.
* I hope to improve my writing and communication skills and this seems like a good way to do it. 
* This is a good way to record or journal what I was thinking about and refresh concepts I learned a long time ago.
* In the instance that someone wants to employ me, but they are unsure of what my knowledge/skills are hopefully they can get some idea of what I know and what I can do.
